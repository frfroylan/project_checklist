#Project Checklist for Web Content Specialist
Project checklist is just that, a webpage with checkboxes associated with important tasks that need to be completed when pushing a new product live.

There is no limit to how many products you can add and each product can be at a different point in the 'go live' process. This allows the web content specialist to avoid using pen and paper while also displaying visual markers to quickly inform them where they are in each products life cycle. 

If you close the Project Checklist window you will LOSE all your product information; reloading will also erase this information. This is a session only webpage.
